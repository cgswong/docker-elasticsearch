# Elasticsearch configuration file #

# Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped across
# the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with most free
# space on creation. For example:
#path.data: /esvol/$inst/data1,/esvol/$inst/data2
path.data: /esvol/data
# Path to log files:
path.logs: /esvol/logs
# Path to where plugins are installed:
path.plugins: /esvol/plugins
# Path to temporary files:
path.work: /esvol/work

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
cluster.name: "{{ .es_cluster }}"

# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
#node.name: "{{ .es_host }}"

# Allow recovery process after N nodes in a cluster are up:
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 1
# Set the timeout to initiate the recovery process, once the N nodes
# from previous setting are up (accepts time value):
gateway.recover_after_time: 5m
# Set how many nodes are expected in this cluster. Once these N nodes
# are up (and recover_after_nodes is met), begin recovery process immediately
# (without waiting for recover_after_time to expire):
#gateway.expected_nodes: 2

# Disable multicast discovery:
discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
# Configure an initial list of master nodes in the cluster
# to perform discovery when new nodes (master or data) are started:
#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["host1", "host2:port"]
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [{{ range getvs "/es/host/*" }} "{{.}}",{{ end }}]

# Elasticsearch performs poorly when JVM starts swapping so ensure that
# it _never_ swaps.
# Set this property to true to lock the memory:
#bootstrap.mlockall: true
